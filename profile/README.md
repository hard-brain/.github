## Introduction  

Hard Brain is an application which proves a Discord bot for running music quizzes for Beatmania IIDX songs. It currently contains all songs from every IIDX AC release (1st style - Resident) and CS release (1st style - EMPRESS + PREMIUM BEST, and Infinitas (2023)). Slash commands can be used to start a quiz, provided that the user is connected to a voice channel.
